This python script scrapes the stories within "Top Stories" section of the google news page, and after parsing them, prints out the headlines alongwith a brief description of each headline. There could be multiple uses of this, but the way I used it was to put this script into my bashrc, so that at every new launch of the terminal, I get the latest news :)

Further refinements coming. Stay tuned!
